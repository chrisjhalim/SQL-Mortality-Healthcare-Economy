# Healthcare Spending and Economic Growth Effect on Child Mortality Rate
Children mortality rate have been decreasing for the last couple of decades. However, I am curious about the extent that increasing healthcare spending and economic growth played towards decreasing child mortality rate. 

## Database
The original database is taken from the website "Our World in Data". There are 2 original databases. 
  ##### Here are the link to both databases: 
  ##### https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-decline-of-child-mortality-by-healtcare-spending-endpoints
  ##### https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/healthcare-expenditure-vs-gdp

The datasets attached in the repository is an Excel-modified dataset from the original dataset. 

## SQL File
The analysis, cleaning, and modification of this data is done in SQL. HealthcareProject file contains the SQL code for this project. I created 4 result spreadsheets from the SQL analysis, to ease the data visualization process in Tableau. The end result will display each country's healthcare spending, economic growth, and child mortality rate. 

## Data Visualization
The result of the analysis become much more apparent after I tabulated the data in Tableau. There is a very clear trend that most if not all countries experience declining child mortality rate. From the Tableau link, you can choose the country you are interested to see the data.
